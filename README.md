A [Discord](https://discord.com) bot using the [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library. Following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyRMklcm2oA&list=PLWnw41ah3I4Z3pJ3_IzohfSu4A1x37KeE) series.

This is mainly me experimenting with different languages. Which in this case would be [Python](https://www.python.org)
